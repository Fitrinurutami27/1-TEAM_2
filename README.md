# Operations using Data Types and Operators
We are from Group 2 Pathway Data Analyst with mentor Sis Suwarti and partner My Edusolve. This time we will share material about the initial introduction to Python that we have received this week
- type data Python :
  1. string :
     The string data type is used to represent text or characters.     
     Strings can contain letters, numbers, or special characters. 
     Example: "Hello, World!".
  3. integer :
     The integer data type is used to represent whole numbers (numbers 
     without decimals), both positive and negative. Example: 1, -5, 100.
  4. float :
     The float (floating-point) data type is used to represent decimal 
     numbers (numbers with decimals). Example: 3.14, -0.5, 2.71828.
  5. boolean :
     The boolean data type is used to represent two possible values: 
     True (true) or False (false). It is often used in decision 
     making and logic. Example: True, False.
  6. complex :
     The complex data type is used to represent complex numbers in mathematics, which consist of real and imaginary parts. Example: 1+2h, -3.5+4h.
